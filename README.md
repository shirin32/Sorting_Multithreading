# Multithreaded Sorting
Understanding performance of Quick Sort algorithm using multi-threading 

The objective of this project is to evaluate the performance of a sorting application with
multithreading.

A list of integers is divided into two smaller lists of equal size. Using two
separate threads, we will sort the two sub lists and then merge them into a single sorted list.

Multithreading increases responsiveness as program continues to run even if the part of it is
blocked. It is also economical as many threads share memory between each other.
